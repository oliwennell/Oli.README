# Oli.README

My name is Oli Wennell, hello and welcome to my README :wave:  

## What Is This?

If I'm your tech lead (or if I'm going to be), this document should help you get to know who I am and how I work.

It is **not** a replacement for us actually getting to know each other.

## My Role

As a tech lead, I am responsible for a team delivering good quality software.

I strongly believe that the best way of achieving this is to ensure the people in the team are willing and able to do great work.

We'll work together to ensure you enjoy what you do, improve your skills and develop your career.

## My Principles

### Respect
I expect us all to treat each other with respect and kindness.

### Safety

*"Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand"*

--Norm Kerth, Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Review

If things go wrong I believe we should look for systemic problems and fix them. Blaming individuals is not helpful.

### Autonomy  

You're an adult so I'll treat you like one.  

I believe people work best when they have autonomy. I will work to give people the *skills*, *context* and *permission* that autonomy requires. 

### Work-life balance  

I believe that people have a right to a life outside work and that people do their best work when they are rested. I do not expect you to work overtime except in truly exceptional circumstances.

### Agile

I subscribe to the principles of the [agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/). I particularly like this bit:  

*"We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it."*

Following a process (scrum, kanban, etc.) is ok, but I hope that people  find what works for them, experiment and adapt, rather than always following the "rules".

## My Availability

Communicating with you is an important part of my job.

If you want to talk to me, feel free to approach me in person or send a message.
  
You can message/email me out of hours, that's fine. But please be aware that I probably won't respond until I'm back at my desk.

## One-to-ones

We will have regular one-to-one chats.  

These are an opportunity to discuss how you're getting on, to exchange feedback, and talk about your goals.

## Feedback

I am always looking for ways to improve. I therefore welcome any feedback you have for me.

If you feel uncomfortable giving it to me personally then it's absolutely fine to tell a third party, such as my boss or someone you trust. And if you'd prefer it was anonymous then that's fine too.
